      image: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Eagle_nebula_pillars.jpg",
      definition: `Stars begin their life in giant clouds of gas and dust called nebulae. Gravity pulls the material together, forming a protostar. When nuclear fusion begins, the star enters the main sequence phase, shining for billions of years.`,
      facts: [
        "The Sun is in its main sequence stage.",
        "Nebulae are often called 'stellar nurseries'.",
        "Protostars can take millions of years to form."

      quiz: [
        { q: "Where do stars form?", options: ["Nebulae", "Black holes", "Asteroids"], answer: "Nebulae" },
        { q: "What is a protostar?", options: ["Dying star", "Forming star", "Planet"], answer: "Forming star" },
        { q: "What process powers stars?", options: ["Nuclear fusion", "Combustion", "Gravity"], answer: "Nuclear fusion" },

      definition: `Stars come in many types based on size, color, and temperature. The smallest are red dwarfs, while the largest are blue giants. Our Sun is a yellow star.`,
      facts: [
        "Red dwarfs are the most common stars in the galaxy.",
        "Blue stars are the hottest, while red stars are the coolest.",
        "White dwarfs are dead stars, the remains of smaller stars."

      definition: `Stars go through stages depending on their size. Small stars like the Sun become red giants and then white dwarfs. Massive stars become supernovae and may form neutron stars or black holes.`,
      facts: [
        "The Sun will eventually become a red giant.",
        "Supernovae create elements like gold and iron.",
        "Black holes form from the death of very massive stars."
      ],
      quiz: [
        { q: "What will the Sun become at the end of its life?", options: ["Neutron star", "Red giant then white dwarf", "Black hole"], answer: "Red giant then white dwarf" },
